Many public-health experts and pharmaceutical leaders have stated publicly that they are worried about a potential glass-vial supply squeeze, due to the pandemic. Of course, rolling out billions of vaccine at record speed is no easy task, and it's necessary to think and plan of solutions for possible problems that may need to be sorted out. For which, it's essential to look at the supply chain from the *start to the end*.

The problem with producing medical glass equipment is that it's supply chain is traditionally fixed, and slow-growing, which means that it is also prone to shortages, such as this one. It only produces on a need-basis, so it doesn't have surge capacity to cater to emergency situations. 

This glass market is inclined towards fragmentation. The surge in government initiatives and increasing demand for injectables and other medicines provide lucrative opportunities in the glass packaging solutions in the pharmaceutical industry. Competitive rivalry is high and the expansion and mergers of large companies in different pharmaceutical industries are expected to increase the demand in the market. 

**But a medical glass shortage was already setting in before the Covid-19 pandemic.**  Procuring raw material is an issue, since sand found alongside riversides is needed, which is different and coarse than the fine, desert sand, which has suffered a setback due to increase in environmental regulations. And even after obtaining these materials, normal glass factories have to undergo significant changes to ramp up vial production. A beverage glass maker cannot simply start producing medical glass equipment. In India itself, it has been difficult, logistically, for bottles and vials makers to provide to pharma companies. For instance, AGI glaspacâ€™s pharma segment, which currently contributes 30-32 % of glass packaging in the Indian pharma packaging industry, is facing hampered production, affected supplies, and increased stock. So far, the company is working partially with limited raw materials like sand and soda ash, the key input raw materials for glass packaging.

Dr. Rick Bright, formerly the head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), alleges he warned of a looming global shortage of glass vials but administration officials did not heed his advice. He wrote that major glass producers have warned that a particular material, borosilicate tubing, is sold out and it could take up to two years to meet the U.S. vaccine need alone .Even after the first batch of vaccines have been sourced and the shortages managed, coronavirus vaccines may have to be followed up every few years, meaning the strain on the supply chain could reappear in just a few years time.

Some manufacturers are already preparing for this potential crunch: [Moderna](https://www.modernatx.com/modernas-work-potential-vaccine-against-covid-19) is exploring both single-use vials and those that can hold multiple vaccine doses, according to its regulatory filings. 

A shortage of vials could interfere not just with the availability of a coronavirus vaccine but a range of other medicines, including sedatives and other drugs administered in hospitals.
