I will go out on a limb and state here that the Covid-19 pandemic is the most defining aeon of our lifetime. Every other concern has become secondary, the primary focus right now is to find a cure for the Covid-19 virus. Research for treating the coronavirus, is being done in record time. New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) reported in February, that it was getting upto 20 submissions each day. 

I did my bachelors in the field of Biotechnology, and in my first class on genetic engineering, we learnt about vaccine development and how it takes years to develop a vaccine (on an average, 10 years). But we don't have that kind of time now, and companies have been working on overdrive to generate a vaccine for the coronavirus.  

To give you some context, the following is the time involved in clinical trials -

Before all of this, months are spent on lab and animal testing. And, some companies are already in Phase 2, which speaks about the fast progress in vaccine development.

#### How do vaccines work?

There are two basic types of vaccines - Live attenuated and inactivated. 

- **Live attenuated vaccines** are produced by modifying the virus in the laboratory, such that it can replicate itself but won't cause any illness.(Ex- Measles, Yellow fever etc.). 
- **Inactivate vaccines**, as the name suggests, are produced by creating the virus I culture media, then inactivating it with heat and/or chemicals, so that it wouldn't replicate. In contrast with live vaccines, that almost resemble a natural infection, the ***antibody titers*** (a measure of amount of antibodies, specifically neutralizing antibodies; used to check if a vaccine is working) against inactivated antigens diminish with time, so multiple doses or "*boosts*" may be required. (Ex- Polio, Rabies, Hep A etc).

Laboratories around the world are now working to create these different kinds of vaccines, but all of them have one goal, to train the immune system to recognize and combat the virus.

An essential entity that is going to help develop the vaccine is - *the spikes*; these spikes are the genetic material that will be identified by our immune system so that it can fight it. ***Moderna***, for example, is developing it's mRNA Covid-19 vaccine, where  the goal is to, inject the "*spike*"(mRNA) into our body which will translate it into a protein, which our immune system will identify and then exterminate (which is pretty cool, tbh). ***GSK*** just started its clinical trials, last Friday, with its booster shots. Some companies are even trying to inject the mRNA inside our body by using a totally different, harmless virus.

#### When will the vaccine be ready?

Anthony Fauci, gave us all hope that the vaccine may be ready by early 2021. WHO stated recently that **10 out of the 120 vaccines** being developed globally are already in human trials. Looking at how fast China is working on a promising development and the fact that it has already published an article in the peer-reviewed medical journal, The Lancelet, about the first in-human clinical trial, we may even have it sooner, but there are some serious concerns. 

People who had contracted the coronavirus and then recovered, had a antibody titer count of at least a 100, so it's safe to say that **100** should ideally be a antibody titer target for any vaccine. In the case of the Chinese vaccine mentioned earlier, out of the three doses administered to the odd 100 volunteers, the highest dose averaged around a count of 34, which is way less. Moreover, 81% of the participants developed at least one adverse reaction within the first seven days of vaccination, so there's still a big question mark on the safety of these vaccines. Similarly, Moderna reported 3 out of its 45 participants, experiencing severe but non-threatening symptoms, all of these 3 participants were given the high dose. During these kind of experimental vaccines, side-effects are pretty common, and with further trials, the dosage is decreased gradually until they find the ideal amount, that has less or negligible reactions and is also able to do its job.


#### Is it possible to make enough of this vaccine for everyone?

To actually create a traditional vaccine, it's essential that you have cells where you can grow them. You put the weakened virus into the cells, create a good environment for them in a bio-reactor and feed it with nutrients, so that it grows well.

<ins>**MORE CELLS = MORE VACCINES**</ins>

But all of this takes months to prepare.

To counter this, the mRNA vaccines can be a game-changer, because you won't be spending time growing the cells, essentially creating multiple doses. The slight issue here being, this has never been done before, so some problems may pop up, but experts agree that producing mRNA in mass quantities is a likely possibility.

Although, even if we actually get a promising vaccine, there's still something companies are really worried about, that may sound trivial - *where to put the vaccines?*

Vaccines are stored in **small vials with stoppers**, that are extremely sterile, and are produced in places that are 100 times cleaner than a hospital. And even though these guys have ramped up all the steps for vaccine production, the real constraint here is to ramp up the production of these tubes, in quality conditions, while also figuring out methods to minimize the delay causing factors, like packaging. Maybe for the first time in world history, companies like Pfizer and Moderna are planning to start manufacturing vaccines on a large scale, while still being in the trial phase, just so that they can cope with the demand when the vaccine is finally approved. 
It's strange, in the end, everything boils down to **LOGISTICS**.

**All of these research and scientific articles is freely available, after 94 academic journals, societies, institutes and companies signed a commitment to do so. It's open to the public, if anyone's interested.*
