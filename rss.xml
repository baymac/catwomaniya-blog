  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to physical distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, E-Commerce orders have skyrocketed and so has the packaging waste that comes with it. My orders at Amazon have become 4x more than what they were before. (Also, because of the Prime account). Anyhow, even though I love how easy they make it to get pretty much everything I need, I can’t help but feel a little guilty while opening up deliveries. There’s just so much packaging waste. After Prime day, my garbage bin was full and overflowing with Amazon’s packaging waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry has huge environmental costs and there are no estimates about the amount of packaging and waste. Let’s try to unpack the problem. (PUN intended :P) firstly, and then discuss the new wave of packaging solutions that are popping up now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;PACKAGING WASTE FROM E-COMMERCE&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all are drowning in a sea of packaging waste, and too much of it is ending up in landfills, or even worse, oceans. With no significant rules around this particular problem, over-packaging is a sought-out solution for many companies, to cater to the growth of priority customer services, that place a premium on ultra-fast delivery which effectively do not allow for consolidated delivery of goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retailers/Sellers are keen on ensuring that their goods arrive in pristine condition, to minimize costs, keeping “customer delight” at the core of it. And to protect those products, online retailers resort to piling on packaging - Bubble wrap, Styrofoam, Air packets, Massive cardboard boxes. Highly effective, but highly wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This affects not just by creating gregarious amounts of waste but also has the potential to lead to considerable loss of forest cover, since wood pulp is the primary raw material for producing packaging cardboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the status quo of packaging has devastating consequences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING STRATEGIES&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sustainablepackaging.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Definition-of-Sustainable-Packaging.pdf&quot;&gt;Sustainable Packaging Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, to be sustainable one has to follow the 8 criteria for packaging mentioned below :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is beneficial, safe &amp;amp; healthy for individuals and communities throughout its lifecycle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meets market criteria for performance and cost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is sourced, manufactured, transported, and recycled using renewable energy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optimizes the use of renewable or recycled source materials.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is manufactured using clean production technologies and best practices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is made from materials healthy throughout the life cycle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is physically designed to optimize materials and energy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is effectively recovered and utilized in biological and/or industrial closed-loop cycles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;COMPANIES SHIFTING TO SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies that utilize e-commerce should look towards more sustainable packaging that has the strength to protect their products effectively and mitigate losses but also ensure recyclability to curb the negative environmental effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be done by factoring in three different aspects of sustainability - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce the amount of packaging material used&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increase in recyclability of packaging materials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use of recycled packaging materials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These companies should also explore the possibility of implementing buy-back policies, or even provide customers with the choice to opt for more sustainable methods of packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Benefits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consolidated Storage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing packaging materials and minimizing waste are two big components of sustainable packaging. And when implemented correctly, they lead to more efficient storage, so you can limit the space required to house your products (thus lowering storage costs), or open up additional space to store more merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower logistic costs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one is pretty intuitive.
Shifting from a box to a bubble mailer can knock anywhere from four to six ounces off the total weight of the package and reduce weight-based costs significantly while shipping. Multiplying this saving across millions of packages a year and the overall reduction in costs can be dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expand customer base and increase loyalty&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upgrading packaging not only decreases a business’ carbon footprint but also can help a brand stand out to customers
A research by Nielsen found that 48% of consumers are willing to change their consumption habits to lower their impact on the environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start-ups are popping up in the field of responsible packaging. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.packmile.com/&quot;&gt;Packmile.com&lt;/a&gt; is a leading sustainable packaging company in India, with clients including Amazon, Bosch and Decathlon and has a portfolio of innovative products like Paper Bubble Wrap and Corrugated Box Recycling Machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How Large and Small Scale Businesses can Use Eco-Friendly Packaging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Large-Scale Businesses&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a large company like Amazon, or Alibaba, there are two primary problems in adopting sustainable packaging. Firstly, these sites have a huge supplier base (maybe in thousands), that are scattered around the country (Or the world), all of whom have to comply with the same regulations. Making a wholesale packaging switch might be a slow and painful process.
Second, as these sites offer millions of products, the next go-to option is to find a producer who can create packaging that’s flexible for every item, and most importantly, has the ability to do so at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Small-Scale Businesses&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small e-commerce business might look like anything from an individual’s craft store - selling just a few items a month - to an independent bookstore that sells a few hundred products a month.
However, for the most part, these  businesses will deal with a much less varied set of products, comparatively, meaning it’s possible for them to depend on a single packaging system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Focusing on AMAZON&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon does have its fair share of eco-friendly initiative in this area, but many of them haven’t been implemented in India. (but let’s keep fingers crossed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Amazon India’s website, they say “ PFS is a sustainable packaging solution in which customer orders are shipped in their original packaging without any additional packaging or significantly reduced packaging.” They had first launched the program in India in June 2019 in nine cities and have now moved to 100 cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sustainable packaging initiatives like ‘frustration-free packaging and ship-in-own container,’ have also been able to reduce packaging waste by 25 percent since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am unsure how that works though, because when I searched for ‘ Frustration free packaging’, the results were spread across only 19 pages, and the numbers do not make sense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway,..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon also has other initiatives that aren’t active in India currently, like providing customers to group their orders together or to opt for no-rush shipping, which empowers the customer to make better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;WHAT NEXT ?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A carefully drafted law and genuine cooperation among all stakeholders, including e-commerce companies, consumers and local municipalities will be the key to ensure that the law is successfully implemented. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more importantly, for effective transformation of e-commerce into Green commerce, companies need to invest in packaging innovation and sustainable supply chain mechanisms to promote reuse and recycling, while consumers also need to display sustainable consumption behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why brands need a better content marketing strategy during Covid-19 pandemic]]></title><description><![CDATA[Content is King.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content is King. (Damn right, it is!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it will play an important part, for brands to help uplift themselves and survive during these tough times. The world is now forever divided into pre COVID-19 and post COVID-19 narratives. Content marketing is how companies can set themselves up for the long term – pandemic or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies have reduced their marketing/content creation spend with their operations being hit, which seems like a logical move, because it essentially means putting your focus into more cost-driven activities, while having less than ideal revenue generating numbers. But going into hibernation is the wrong move here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things will go back to normal – or some new type of normal. When this happens, brands should have some momentum built up, something that can help them grow and thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our daily routines have changed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While each one of us might have a different kind of day routine basis our jobs and responsibility division at home, but somethings are glaringly common amongst all of us :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consumption of digital media has increased &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Washing dishes has become an everyday task&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cooking/Baking activities have increased, for a plethora of reasons. And people are either entering their kitchens for the first time or on their way to become a chef. You know how I know that ? Instagram stories (So, again this circles back to point number one). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Instagram stories gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital experiences have abruptly replaced in-person experiences. Our content consumption has increased multi-fold and is greater than ever right now. According to recent data, the total minutes on the internet increased to 1466 minutes during April 2020 (a 11% increase from March 2020), as COVID-19 kept people indoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demand is massive, and with more time at hand, content creators are creating way more content than they ever did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What companies are doing right&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the lockdown happened, many brands have taken inspiration from how mankind overcame setbacks such as The Great Depression, oil crisis in 1973 or even the 2007-08 economic recession to reassure consumers that the humankind has the strength and intelligence to emerge at the top of any challenge they face, including COVID-19, while keeping a positive tone as the underlying feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding new ways to reach your customers during an economic crisis is not new. Being all “the glass is half full”, this is the time for companies to break out their thinking hats and turn on innovation. Let’s take a step back, to the Great Depression. While many companies were re-evaluating their finances and cutting down on expenses, P&amp;amp;G’s marketing team took a different approach. As many people were staying in homes, the company started sponsoring radio broadcasts - which were relatively new at the time – with a key message, to promote the basic necessity - soap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it was all said and done, P&amp;amp;G came out of the Great Depression in a much better shape than before! (FUN FACT: This also led to the origin of the term “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2017/10/04/our-history-p-g-put-soap-soap-opera/732149001/&quot;&gt;soap opera&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the pandemic in the rear-view mirror, the biggest shift in content marketing is going to see a new emphasis on digital experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent efforts, consistent communication, frequent reminders - are some crucial ways for companies to engage and connect with customers. Right now, the winning ticket is to create content that is relevant to your business and informative, in a way that helps your potential customer or is entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in the B2B area , &lt;a href=&quot;https://moz.com/&quot;&gt;Moz&lt;/a&gt; , started giving away all their courses (except a certification one) at Moz Academy for free. That is some $1500+ worth of courses! And while they are obviously missing out on good revenue in the short term, the long-term impact is much higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content marketing and SEO, work so well together, they both go hand-in-hand. This was a brilliant move by the company to attract marketers across the industry, become familiar with the tools/program, learn skills and build a monumental amount of trust, so that when all of this is done marketer’s will know where to turn to when they are looking for SEO software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the B2C area, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cure.fit/cult/livesgt&quot;&gt;Cult.fit&lt;/a&gt; , a health and fitness company, launched their LIVE workout classes for free (Update: Launched paid subscription classes during late-may), just days before the lockdown was announced in India. In these workout classes, people could compete with fellow attendees or with their friends, which made for one engaging digital experience. They are also posting regular and engaging content to educate users on their app. The company is putting a considerable amount of resources into helping people stay active, healthy and positive - together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Marketing in a post-covid world&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to jump forward to the future, but we are at a stage to make some logical hypotheses for what’s coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional advertising is going to become all but &lt;em&gt;gone&lt;/em&gt;. Priority of health &amp;amp; wellness and fear of unemployment lurking around has changed consumer’s behaviour. The concept of advertising via physical objects like direct mailers, paper newspapers etc. Can and will become obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier, more people are consuming content on their devices, especially while streaming Netflix or via social media channels. It’s likely for traditional TV advertising to be replaced by a more digital, robust model. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;User-generated content will see a rise, as the need for people to create connections will increase. A great way for brands to make more engaging content, is to give their customers or their employees, the spotlight, a place where they can be vulnerable and share their stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&amp;#x27;./2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;People connected&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There will be a lot of reluctance to get out of homes needlessly. Consumers will have questions about their favourite businesses, restaurants, go-to spots and about new businesses that have sprung up. And most of them will rely on trusty, old Google, to get these answers before actually venturing out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why content marketing works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be a fundamental shift in consumer behaviour and how consumers look at brands. Brands with a purpose and meaning will resonate more with consumers, and in a more effective manner. It’s important for brands to communicate who they are and not just what they sell. Content marketing and thought leadership can help in creating that connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the period of uncertainty is here and will likely stay for some more time, consumers won’t have time for generalities and good to know material. They will look for information which could help them in navigating their situation better, and decide better Meaningful content should be build around the question “What’s in it for me”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/d03cbe9dede53018e5dcc88f67be4c1a/4.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Connect to consumers&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social listening and community engagement will be at the forefront while developing a marketing strategy. For example, companies were already hosting quizzes and sharing polls on twitter for a long time, but they have moved on to create mini-events like movie watch-along nights and leveraged the use of other channels like Instagram to increase their reach. Remember, how quick brands went on to create delightful and funny &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adgully.com/momentmarketing-how-brands-are-reacting-to-pubg-ban-in-india-96139.html&quot;&gt;illustrative content&lt;/a&gt; after Indian banned PUBG. More of that, please!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than anything else, content marketing is meant for success because it meets people where they are. Sure, we’ll likely reach a point where people will go out and about managing their day-to-day activities, but it may be a good long while before we flock back to movie theatres and restaurants. And how will people occupy their time? By consuming content on their devices, more specifically smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who knows what uncertainties may arise in the following months. We simply cannot say what will happen in the economy, in coronavirus, in marketing. Although one thing is for sure, content marketing seems like a pretty safe bet to put your money on. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why you should rather be using a menstrual cup ?]]></title><description><![CDATA[FYI - This post is a tad bit different from my previous posts and is proportionately biased by my personal experiences, and many TMI alerts…]]></description><link>https://catwomaniya.io/blog/why-you-should-rather-be-using-a-menstrual-cup/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://catwomaniya.io/blog/why-you-should-rather-be-using-a-menstrual-cup/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FYI - This post is a tad bit different from my previous posts and is proportionately biased by my personal experiences, and many TMI alerts, because I will get into graphic details.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been waiting to write about this since the beginning of this year, and my time has come. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/3e9e54032ab1d69553db6e0b37b95d90/1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Old turtle saying his time has come&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having only used plain ol’ sanitary napkins, my next go-to move was to try tampons. Of course, this decision only materialized a year ago, when I was on a trip that involved getting wet/being in water and I didn’t want something this trivial to “wash” over all my plans. Out of the need for better leakage-control, and after being vetted by many,many of my girlfriends, I took the plunge and got some tampons. My worries of leakage, stains, rashes, disposal subsided. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A girl was happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to January 2020, and I decided to self-check and analyse my life’s activities with sustainability and zero waste at the crux of it. Now of course, I was going to look into menstrual waste generated through single-use pads and tampons and find ways to reduce my output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I heard about Menstrual Cups for the first time, probably some 3-4 years ago, and the very fact of putting some alien object inside me, made me shudder. More so, the fact that one had to reuse the same cup multiple times, seemed extremely unhygienic to me. (It’s really not)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why use a menstrual cup&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping aside the fact that a person uses (more specifically, myself) 10 sanitary pads in a month, which becomes 120 pads in a year, which can potentially lead to using 4560 pads in their lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/69442cb956c9ee33a7c097f0864932dc/2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Girl saying that&amp;#x27;s a lot&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I decided to find a solution. A quick 2 hour web search told me all about the various sanitary products, and after some discussions on online forums like Reddit, which also involved a detailed comparison of biodegradable pads Vs Menstrual cups, I made my decision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FYI, Biodegradable pads are great, well almost, because they need to be segregated and personally composted in a separating compost pit, so that they can actually go back to earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How menstrual waste is treated currently&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you guessed, landfills, you’re absolutely correct!
Only two cities in India — Bengaluru and Pune — implement solid waste interventions to effectively segregate and identify menstrual waste during routine garbage collection.
Anyway, it still goes through some small scale incineration or burying for disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;My experience with it&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read many articles/reviews and watched thousands of YouTube videos that reviewed the product, gave tips on insertion/removal, hygiene tips etc. before actually committing to the product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/33d516926be02938f4bbac4f3fcae13f/3.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Cat reading book&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I bought this - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.in/Sirona-Approved-Reusable-Menstrual-Silicone/dp/B07548J9WC/ref=pd_lpo_121_t_0/259-8192318-0440851?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;pd_rd_i=B07548J9WC&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=d68b39f7-8abc-4229-8bf4-aa368625d22d&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=fo244&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=egqhS&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=5a903e39-3cff-40f0-9a69-33552e242181&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=KYTABYFRHBEJC7Z5V39E&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;refRID=KYTABYFRHBEJC7Z5V39E&amp;amp;smid=AT95IG9ONZD7S&quot;&gt;Sirona Reusable Menstrual Cup for Women - Medium Size&lt;/a&gt; from Amazon, because it had more reviews and a good amount of 4-star reviews. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Step 1 : Unboxing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the box I received was not in a great state, which may be due to the fact that it spent 5 days outside, to quarantine it. But the actual cup was vacuum sealed in plastic, so it was all okay inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Step 2 : Sanitization&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One has to sanitize the cup before using it for the first time, by boiling it in plain water for 10 minutes or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cup needs to be folded before inserting it, and there are various techniques for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I personally like the punchdown folding method)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Step 3 : Insertion&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#TMI&lt;/strong&gt;
I remember that dance I did in the bathroom when I tried to use a tampon for the first time. I thought it would be something like that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took some 20-30 minutes to figure it out the first time. But I had patience and a handy knowledge of positions/tricks to experiment with.
Knowing how to relax your pelvic muscles is a must. I found squatting was the best position, where I could use both my hands to insert it - one to part the labia and the other to put the cup and push it inside (Rim should be facing up)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once it’s inside a suction will be created, and I normally walk/run/glide/jump a bit to ensure that it’s firmly in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quite honestly, it didn’t feel like anything. I have used tampons before and I have been aware of their presence while using them, but this was new, in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Step 4 : Removal&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#TMI&lt;/strong&gt;
Of course, the fear of being unable to remove the cup was always there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 10 hours, when I went to the bathroom to remove the cup, I couldn’t feel the tip/stem of the cup so I was scared, and fully dreading the scenario of going to a hospital to get it removed, even though I knew that’s an unlikely scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:300px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Panik man&quot; title=&quot;Panik man&quot; src=&quot;/static/0576b2387337cd3be4c02ffb784e9d8a/f93b5/40.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;/static/0576b2387337cd3be4c02ffb784e9d8a/a80bd/40.jpg 148w,/static/0576b2387337cd3be4c02ffb784e9d8a/1c91a/40.jpg 295w,/static/0576b2387337cd3be4c02ffb784e9d8a/f93b5/40.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, of course, I used my pelvic muscles to push it out, until I could feel the tip. Again using two hands here - one was to hold the tip in place so it doesn’t get sucked back in again, the other hand was used to get a finger inside, in between the rim of the cup and the vaginal wall, to break suction. I did this in the shower area, for chances of spillage. I will be honest, it wasn’t the most comfortable experience, but after repeated use I did get a hang of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you try removing it like a tampon, and yank it out, It will definitely hurt you. Break the seal first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there it was, hardly some 5 mL of menstrual blood. I honestly believed I bled a lot, by looking at the after-state of my sanitary pads, but that’s not true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This blood was then flushed down the toilet and cleaned with running water, for further use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Step 5 : Final Wash and Storage&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yay. Periods are over!
I washed it in boiling water on the last day and kept it in a cloth bag, which came along with the cup. It’s important to ensure that this bag is next kept in a clean and dry place, until the next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One also needs to keep in mind to wash their hands with soap before and after using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Advantage of using a menstrual cup&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/1bd5f41889d0b633c72e894b607ba848/5.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Menstrual cup&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Less landfill waste&lt;/em&gt; - It’s a super eco-friendly menstrual product. One cup can be used for some 10 years which is the equivalent of using 1800 pads&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Low cost&lt;/em&gt; - The cup that I bought costs INR 300. The pads that I used previously had an average cost of INR 10 per pad. Assuming, the lifetime of the cup is 10 years and not taking into account any external factors, the cup is saving me some INR 11700 (12000-300)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;More time between changes&lt;/em&gt; - Now, this may vary from person to person but the number of times I have to change the cup Vs pad, is on the lower side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super comfy&lt;/em&gt; - It is much more comfortable than pads. I cannot emphasize this enough, I didn’t feel its presence at all. On the bad side, you may actually forget it and leave it inside for a longer time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can work out with it&lt;/em&gt; - I went for a jog, did yoga, did a basic calisthenics workout while using the cup, and it didn’t feel any different. Using pads while exercising was a painful task, because it led to skin bruising on the inner thighs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feels more hygienic&lt;/em&gt; - Pads always keep touching you, they lead to rashes, abrasions, whatnot. And don’t even get me started on the odor, which keeps reminding you throughout the day that you’re wearing a pad. Cups on the other hand, don’t release any odors because the fluid doesn’t get exposed to the air.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teaches you more about female anatomy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t want to read that graphic description? I got you. Adding a FAQ sort-of section below which is more informational&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are menstrual cups safe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re super safe. Unless you’re allergic to silicone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does a menstrual cup work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like a tampon, it is inserted into your vagina, but instead of absorbing your flow, like a tampon or pad, it catches and collects it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are they made of&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can be made of medical-grade silicone, rubber or latex.
They do not contain any chemicals, as compared to pads and tampons, which may contain bleach and dioxin. (Some dioxins can cause cancer)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the price of a menstrual cup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can fall in the range of INR 250 - 1000.
It’s cheaper in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What factors should you consider while buying a cup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Size - There is no standard sizing chart but brands provide sizes based on flow and cervix position.
Color - Opting for a darker color is my go to thought, since it won’t have that wear-down look after multiple uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to put in a menstrual cup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many folding techniques you can try to find what works for you. Here is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnK8J8fQxk&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to clean a menstrual cup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warm water and mild soap will do the job just right.
Definitely clean out the suction holes, which are present near the rim. They help in releasing the suction, when you need to remove it.
If you want to remove stains, some scrubbing and a vinegar solution will come in handy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to remove a menstrual cup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to do here is relax your muscles and use both hands.
Hold onto the stem of the cup with one hand and use the other hand to insert one finger between the rim and vaginal wall, to let air inside, after which the cup can be pulled outside in the standing position, to avoid leakage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A BBC post said that you shouldn’t be pushing your pelvic muscles as it can lead to pelvic organ prolapse, which may happen to people who have a higher cervix, so instead get in a deep squat, breathe with an open mouth and pinch down the base or body of cup to break seal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can a cup get stuck inside your body&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your vaginal canal is actually pretty narrow with a comforting dead end at your cervix. It literally cannot be swallowed up by your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to respond to nature calls with a cup inside&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s no biggie. The cup is inside the vagina and pee comes out of the urethra - different holes.
Same thing for pooping. There may be some pressure that causes the cup to shift, so a check may be necessary after doing the deed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How often should you remove it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be left on for upto 12 hours, and works well for heavy flow days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there any leakage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not at all.
Definitely look out for the ‘pop’ sound to ensure the cup is sealed well. If not, the cup isn’t fitted perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it painful to insert/remove&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, the first few trials are difficult. But practice makes it perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can a virgin use the cup / Will it break their hymen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, it can. So can a lot of things like riding a bike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended list of brands available in India&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lenacup.com/&quot;&gt;Lena Cup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://shecup.com/&quot;&gt;She Cup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sironaindia.com/product/menstrual-cup/&quot;&gt;Sirona Cup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.in/Boondh-BOONDH-SUNSHINE-YELLOW-MENSTRUAL-CUP/dp/B07GLWST46&quot;&gt;Boondh Cup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.in/CUPVERT-Reusable-Menstrual-Women-Medium/dp/B07S6SL8CT&quot;&gt;Cupvert Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What is donut economics ?]]></title><description><![CDATA[While in college, they taught me about basic economics, supply-demand, etc. And I have long believed that GDP is a really important factor…]]></description><link>https://catwomaniya.io/blog/what-is-donut-economics/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://catwomaniya.io/blog/what-is-donut-economics/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:510px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in college, they taught me about basic economics, supply-demand, etc. And I have long believed that GDP is a really important factor for the economy to function and that it can tell me about the well-being of the people of a nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Circular Flow of Income shows households providing labour and capital to firms, in returns for wages, which they later spend on goods and services, and so it goes round.The unpaid work of carers - particularly housewives - is ignored, no economy can function without them .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This portrayal of the economy as a closed loop of money and resources has been lodged into the brain of every individual, and just like me, hardly anyone questions it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;PANDEMIC&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am seeing endless debates on news channels and reports about the pandemic’s effect on economies around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global economy is expected to shrink by over 3 per cent in 2020 – the steepest slowdown since the Great Depression of the 1930s.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In India, the unemployment rate reached 27.1 per cent in early May, as nearly 122 million Indians lost their jobs between March and April. Experts beleive a significant perecentage of these jobs will not be recovered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s kind of hard to imagine the social and economic effect that is coming our way, it doesn’t look good at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_COVID_19_Risks_Outlook_Special_Edition_Pages.pdf&quot;&gt;COVID-19 Risks Outlook - A Preliminary Mapping and its Implications&lt;/a&gt; raises the alarm bell on a potential vicious future cycle of “continued environmental degradation, biodiversity loss and further zoonotic infectious disease outbreaks”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s definitely tempting to compare current economic projections with the 2008 financial crisis, it’s not going to be the same. The aftermath is going to be more problematic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quote Nobel laureate economist, Joseph E. Stiglitz, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In many ways, it’s far worse than 2008.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s tempting to fall back to old methods and rely on the economist’s traditional toolbox to fix these problems, this may be an opportunity for institutes and think tanks around the world, to make a case for a shift in economic thinking. In the wake of a dire socio-economic crisis, what seems impossible or what was deemed unnecessary a few months back, is now on the forefront.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is a &lt;strong&gt;doughnut&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/ed683e65da28294e232890f1c687b670/doh.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Homer Simpson with donuts&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brainchild of Kate Raworth, an English economist working for the University of Oxford, authored the book &lt;strong&gt;“Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist”&lt;/strong&gt; which was a hit and is again gaining quite some eyeballs after the pandemic hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raworth’s bestselling book (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.in/Doughnut-Economics-Kate-Raworth/dp/1847941389&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;) has graced the bedside tables of multiple economists and politicians. It is described as a “breakthrough alternative to growth economics”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawn as two concentric circles (i.e., donut) explaining the flow between materials and energy, to remind us that we are more than just workers and cash generators/consumers. It’s a graphical representation of the world we should create. The inner ring of the doughnut is inspired by the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and represents the minimum things we need to lead a good life –clean water, shelter, gender equality. The outer ring of the doughnut is defined by the ecological limits one oughts to respect to avoid damaging the environment and disrupting the climate. The ‘dough’, therefore, represents the resources we can use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE BOOK&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions present images of the exclusive goal of economy as growth, of economy as a self-contained system and humans as rational, self-interested and dominant over nature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talks about market organism, rather than market mechanisms. Wonders if economists would see themselves as gardeners who are stewards rather than believing that things will self-regulate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explore the dynamics of a complex organic economic system, that is distributive and regenerative  by design. Regenerative by design gives a way for people to become full participants in regenerating Earth’s life giving cycles so that we thrive within planetary boundaries. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wonders about an economic design that promotes human prosperity whether GDP is going up, down, or holding steady.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NO CRITICISM?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, of course, there is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free-market economists have criticized Raworth’s theories, stating that her ambitious programs needed to meet social needs and protect the environment are impossible without massive economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, it fails to give a clear explanantion about the socially-contructed desired minimum levels and the thresholds above which environmnetal problems are likely. These values, especillay the critical natural thresholds (OCean pH, carbon footprint etc.)
Despite its conceptual strength, the doughnut model fails to explain how such a transformation can be managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;SEEING THE DONUT IN ACTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amsterdam offers an example of how this may actually work in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the strategy, Amsterdam aims to cut food waste by 50 per cent by 2030, from 41 kilos of annual food waste per person today, with the surplus being carried over to residents who need it the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amsterdam plans to implement stricter sustainability requirements in construction tenders. For instance, buildings will get a ‘materials passport’ so that demolition companies can determine whether materials are still valuable and/or where reusable materials can be found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The municipality also plans on reducing its own use of new raw materials by 20% and by 2030, only make circular purchases. (What the heck are &lt;a href=&quot;http://circularpp.eu/&quot;&gt;circular purchases&lt;/a&gt;?) This is not just applicable to the procurement of products such as office supplies, computer equipment but also to infrastructure projects such as road-building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amsterdam has already started working with businesses and research organisations on over 200 circular economy projects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although, experts also suggest that this isn’t going to be easy. This strategy is asking the people of Amsterdam to venture out and experiment, accept risk and break old habits, towards a better future, whose benefits may not even be visible in the near future or in the local vicinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More so, France used it to report on its sustainable development last year, allowing the country to take a look at the interactions between human needs and overall respect for the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a poll of 29 countries, 65% of the people said they want their governments to prioritize Climate change during pandemic recovery. Germany is already planning to use stimulus money to build green infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How is medical waste disposed of?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hospitals, clinics, nursing homes and medical colleges were generating an increasing amount of biomedical waste in an unscientific manner…]]></description><link>https://catwomaniya.io/blog/how-is-medical-waste-disposed-of/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://catwomaniya.io/blog/how-is-medical-waste-disposed-of/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospitals, clinics, nursing homes and medical colleges were generating an increasing amount of biomedical waste in an unscientific manner, even before the pandemic hit. Although hospitals protect and save human life, the by-products generated cause great damage to the environment and especially to the people who work closely with this waste. The abysmal waste management practices in these institutions add to the problem and cause exposure to health hazards and environmental problems. The issue of medical waste identification, handling, and disposal needs to have a heightened review so that better management practices and protocols can be established, and necessary efforts should be made to execute them on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait, so what is medical waste? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadly, any waste generated during diagnosis and treatment, which includes contaminated items such as human tissues, body fluids, blood, equipment (beddings, syringes, sharp objects, dressings, etc). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment and disposal of healthcare waste may pose health risks indirectly through the release of pathogens and toxic pollutants into the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improper segregation of biomedical waste and different medical waste streams from where they originate can trigger a domino-like effect on the environment which can later become a possible threat to people, animals, or soil and water sources. It has the potential to contaminate groundwater sources, which in turn may enter the ecosystem and then disrupt humans lives too. From hospital waste collection and storage to landfills, biomedical waste needs to be properly contained to keep it away from birds, rodents, and stray animals (as well as humans). This means emphasizing packaging and labelling of contaminants and helps prevent the spread of illness through human and animal populations – by air, land, or water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not properly contained, segregated, incinerated (on site/off site), environmental hazards associated with improper healthcare waste management has the potential to contaminate the air we breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Current policies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), released guidelines for handling, treatment and safe disposal of biomedical waste generated during treatment, diagnosis and quarantine of patients confirmed or suspected to have the novel coronavirus disease, during March 2020 itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said that waste that can infect people with coronavirus needs to be segregated through color coding; they fall in Red and Yellow categories.
RED bin—used PPE such as goggles, face shield, splash-proof apron, plastic coverall, hazmat suit, gloves, lab equipment like plastic vials, tubes, pipette tips etc.
YELLOW bin—masks (the N95 included), head cover/cap, shoe cover, disposable linen, gown, non-plastic or semi-plastic coveralls, faeces from COVID-19 patient using bed pans or disposable diapers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pollution watchdog recommends fast disposal of such waste. But do the hospitals actually comply with these rules ? CPCB doesn’t have an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Current methods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:560px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are various processes like on-site incineration, steam disinfection, microwave disinfection, autoclave disinfection, and mechanical/chemical disinfection that are currently in use for managing harmful waste in developing countries. Mostly incineration practices are found in Argentina, Brazil, India, and Bangladesh. Although, hospital waste incinerators operate under sub-optimal conditions and are non-functional due to different reasons. The irony is that the hospital administration emphasizes only the installation of incinerators and often pays attention to its functioning and maintenance. Hospital personnel are reluctant to safely dispose and engage in proper handling of hospital waste, from the director to waste-collector level . So the common methods which are used in developing countries are burning, selling, burial, and dumping to dispose of medical waste. Mostly government hospitals collect their waste in open bins/common places and leave them for 1–2 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preferred method with the least impact on the environment is having it treated by an autoclave. These devises use pressurized air and steam to sterilize the waste and can be used to treat 90% of medical waste. The waste is then shredded, reducing its volume significantly, and taken to a landfill.
There are 199 common bio-medical waste treatment facilities (CBWTFs) in operation and 23 are under construction (CPCB, 2017). However, as per CBWTF operators, setting up such facilities is not economically feasible for considering non-availability of funds for operation, non-compliance with segregation of such wastes at the HCFs level and non-payment of fees by them to the CBWTF personnel. A lenient behaviour is observed in waste segregation by the HCFs which makes using these incinerators, not as productive &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are various gaps which need to be focused upon. One such is that in most of the hospitals enforcement and monitoring of rules that are in lax. Defaulters (HCFs, CBWTFs) are mostly, either suspended or their contracts are cancelled through District Magistrate (DM) but, are never levied heavily for their non-compliance
HCFs and regulatory authorities have to take stringent measures in order to ensure safe disposal of BMW in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The awareness of biomedical waste practices among healthcare professionals is alarmingly unsatisfactory in India. Health care professionals comprising of doctors, nurses, lab technicians and class IV employees were tested and it was found that nurses had more awareness about the proper disposal of waste than other healthcare personnel. Also, Class IV employees had lower knowledge, which is a trend found in most countries around the world. The unsettling thing here is that the study was conducted in Mangalore, a place well-known for superior healthcare facilities, so one wonders how the numbers will be affected if one moves to a medically-poorer region in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Impact on environment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Water pollution&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incineration of biomedical waste contains a high concentration of heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and results in unfavourable amounts of hazardous materials and may pollute surface and groundwater. Hence, it is important to eliminate the toxicity of ash before disposal into landfills or reutilization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worst part about dumping in landfills is the presence of heavy metals from biomedical waste cause a risk to the environment especially in unlined landfills where dissipation of leachate into ground water might occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Air pollution&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incinerated materials containing or treated with chlorine can generate dioxins and furans, which are human carcinogens and have been associated with a range of adverse health effects. Incineration of heavy metals or materials with high metal content (in particular lead, mercury and cadmium) can lead to the spread of toxic metals in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treating medical waste during Covid-19&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it is early to have exact figures, by some estimates, medical waste generation has increased six-fold compared to pre-COVID-19 times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per the reports of The South China Morning Post, during the height of the outbreak in Wuhan, the city was dealing with 240 tons of medical waste per day, versus 40 tons prior to that. In the Indian scenario, there is lack of exact data on the subject, but conservative estimates draw a grim picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Covid outbreak has put India’s unsophisticated garbage treatment system — especially its inadequate handling capacity for biomedical waste—to a massive test. The country has produced nearly 1,700 tonnes of biomedical waste a day between 2016 and 2018, according to Parliament data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bigger challenge here is: the lack of waste etiquette among the people. There is a alarmingly lack of awareness among the people as well as ground-level garbage collectors. Masks and sanitiser bottles have become a common sight on roads. There have been instances of waste from “containment zones” or inf­ection hotspots getting mixed with those from “safe localities” despite express dir­ections to sanitation staff to separate the two. Besides, as seen in mnay instances, people hardly follow the rules, the standard operating procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Society’s perception and practice of ind­iscriminate disposal of items can be a potential source of infection to municipal workers, thus increasing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/covid-19-deaths-6-chennai-sanitation-workers-unrecorded-no-solatium-families-127892&quot;&gt;number of deaths among sanitation workers&lt;/a&gt;. People should dispose of used napkins, tissues, empty sanitiser bottles in a separate bag, to ensure the safety of municipal workers and ragpickers and keep it untouched for at least 3 days before disposing them off to ensure garbage collection and plastic recycling doesn’t get affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 15,000 more waste management personnel have a risk of contracting secondary infection every day from the plastic bags filled with used syringes, sharps, catheters, face masks, hazmat suits, and all conceivable clinical garbage. They cover up in overalls, but the risk they take is not covered—no insurance, poor pay, and no acknowledgement either from the government or people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the garbage collected is plastic — N-95 masks are made up of polyisoprene (natural rubber) and polypropylene (thermoplastic); face shields are all plastic. The protocol says used disposable masks, gloves, aprons, head covers and so on should be incinerated or given a burial—at least 100 feet deep. India has over 1,200 registered plastic recyclers. But the PPE suits manufactured in India cannot be recycled. A company owner says: “Polypropylene is used for the kits that are available and cheap.” Recycling of poly materials is high and India currently has no facility for this. Since coveralls are widely used now—from beauty parlours and salons to weddings and hospitals—the question remains where will the waste go?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Is sustainable fashion really sustainable ?]]></title><description><![CDATA["How much clean water does it take to make one pair of jeans?" - That is the question that made me delve into the textile industry and the…]]></description><link>https://catwomaniya.io/blog/How-does-sustainable-clothing-benefit-the-environment/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://catwomaniya.io/blog/How-does-sustainable-clothing-benefit-the-environment/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;“How much clean water does it take to make one pair of jeans?” - That is the question that made me delve into the textile industry and the disastrous effect it has on the environment. I was baffled, I am one of those people who won’t repeat their fancy clothes, after wearing them once. I felt responsible for all the times I had splurged money on discount sales. By the way, the answer to that question is 3,781 litres, from the production of the cotton to the final product. To bring some context, a person needs an average of 20 litres, to take care of basic hygiene and food needs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/emergencies/qa/emergencies_qa5/en/&quot;&gt;according to WHO&lt;/a&gt;), which would mean this amount of water could help the water scarcity crisis, and help alleviate the needs of 189 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;RAW MATERIALS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you take any item out of your wardrobe and check the materials tag, I bet you will find a significant amount of synthetic materials like Polyester,etc. in it. Let’s go on to a detailed analysis of the major materials found in clothes -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;COTTON
Cotton is the most common natural fibre, used to make clothing which accounts for more than 33% of all fibres that is found in textiles. From the outside, it may seem like anything natural isn’t necessarily bad, but that’s not entirely true. The concerning thing is, cotton is also a very thirsty crop, it requires around 2700 Litres of water - what one person drinks in two and a half years - which is used to make one cotton shirt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s considered even more problematic because it consumes huge quantities of land, pesticides and fertilisers to produce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;POLYESTER
Polyester production has a lower environmental impact than natural fibres production in terms of water usage and wastewater. However, the energy required to produce polyester (125 MJ of energy per kilogram produced) and the greenhouse gas emitted (14.2 kg of CO 2 per kilogram produced) make it a high-impact process. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factories who are producing polyester without proper wastewater treatment systems has the potential to release dangerous substances including antimony, cobalt, manganese salts, sodium bromide and titanium dioxide into the environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;CELLUSLOSICS
Viscose, lyocell, acetate and modal are all examples of man-made cellulosics. As a plant-based fiber, man-made cellulosics have the potential to be a more sustainable choice because they are renewable.  It’s safe to say that of the man-made cellulosic options, lyocell is considered best in class as it is made in a closed-loop system that recycles most of the solvent used so that no chemicals enter the waste stream. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;PROCESSING AND GARMENT PRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 1,900 chemicals are used in the production of clothing, of which 165 has been classified by EU as hazardous to health or the environment.
The textile industry uses high volumes of water throughout its operational activities, from the washing of fibres to bleaching, dyeing and washing of finished products. On average, approximately 200 litres of water is required to produce l kg of textiles. Moreover, this whole process generates large volumes of wastewater that contains a wide variety of chemicals. The chemicals that cause concern when left in the environment can show subsequent characteristics: durability (not easily degraded), bio-accumulation (collect in living organisms) and poisonousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most of the countries in which garments are produced, untreated toxic-water from textiles factories are dumped directly into the rivers. This wastewater contains toxic substances such as lead, mercury, and arsenic, among others, which is obviously extremely harmful for the aquatic life and the health of the millions people living by those rivers banks. Moreover, fish, shellfish and other aquatic creatures ingest the microplastics from these cloth fabrics, which accumulate, concentrating toxins up the food chain. These can enter human food chains and pass into the wider environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of limited transparency in the early value chain and a plethora of different chemicals with varying levels of hazardous impact, it is difficult to choose a proxy that captures impacts ranging from pollution of waterways to the health effects of airborne chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;TRANSPORT AND DISTRIBUTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This step isn’t very concerning, by only accounting for 2 % of the climate-change impact of the industry, as most large players have optimised the flow of goods. However, this stage is also characterised by waste generated through packaging, tags, hangers and bags, as well as by a large proportion of products that never reach consumers as the unsold leftovers are thrown away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;END OF LIFE&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In India, the end of the line for our garments is limited to charity, which eventually fill up local landfills, where they release methane. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, instead of recycling the fabrics and textiles that are over-loading India’s landfills, the country is importing huge quantities of second-hand clothing from countries all over the world. In 2015, India emerged as the world’s largest importer of worn clothing and used textiles. US, UK and Germany were the top 3 exporters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a resort, we look into recycling, but that also faces a number of issues, meaning that globally, only less than one percent of all materials that are used in clothing is recycled back into clothing This reflects a lack of technologies for sorting the collected clothing, separating blended fibres. This is why most clothes are recycled mechanically; they are cut up and shredded, which means that the fibres are shorter, lower quality and lose 75 % of their value. They are therefore not usually used to manufacturing new clothes, but are rather ‘down-cycled’ into insulation material, wiping cloths or mattress stuffing, which is still a better step to ensure minimal wastage. Technologies for chemical recycling that produce virgin fibres of a high quality are available for polyester and nylon and are slowly becoming available, but are not yet fully economically viable, for cotton and blends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, we know that most clothes now are either polyester or part polyester, we are still a long way from ‘closing the loop’ - it’s a pain. The majority of recycled polyester yarn and fabrics comes from recycled plastic – rPET – in particular from plastic bottles. This seems a more environmentally sustainable solution to virgin polyester – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.commonobjective.co/article/fibre-briefing-polyester&quot;&gt;it uses between 30 and 50 per cent less energy, reduces the need for primary extraction of crude oil and cuts the amount disposed in landfills&lt;/a&gt;. But then again, each time plastic is reheated for recycling it degrades, so there’s a constraint on recycling it indefinitely (though researchers and start-up businesses are developing some innovative ideas and solutions to this). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The base colour of the plastic chips from the recycled plastic can make dyeing more difficult, so more dye and more water are needed – although inconsistent coloration can still occur.  WHat’s good about polyester also causes problems later on - polyester can be blended with other fibres but it causes problems with recycling. Of all the polyester produced each year, more gets used in poly-cotton blends than in 100 per cent polyester fabric. It is not currently possible to commercially separate poly-cotton and recycle the constituent fibres, although there are some innovative developments in this area. Most poly-cotton fabrics that do enter recycling, rather than just being landfilled, get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oberk.com/packaging-crash-course/downcycling-temp&quot;&gt;‘downcycled’&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;THE SOLUTION?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First let’s answer - &lt;strong&gt;What does sustainable clothing even mean?&lt;/strong&gt;
This term essentially means that the materials used to make the final clothing is maybe organic, biodegradable, eco-friendly, recycled, upcycled, ethical and/or promotes fair trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three ways to look at this - What can companies do? What can we, as individuals do? What can the government do ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various ways to address these issues have been proposed, including developing new business models for clothing rental and changing consumer behavior that focuses more on recylcing and re-using.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slow fashion
In the  world of everyone running after tech companies, ‘Fast Fashion’ was the saviour for the retail industry. This was after a long time of witnessing no innovation in the industry. Don’t get me wrong, this is a brilliant concept, but it grew too fast, too soon, without anyone to regulate the companies. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other side is slow fashion, an attempt to convince consumers to buy fewer clothes of better quality and to keep them for a longer time. The philosophy includes reliance on trusted supply chains, traditional crafting techniques, small-scale production and using local materials. It calls for a change in the economic model, towards selling fewer clothes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved collection and recycling
Producers and importers can be made legally responsible for ensuring that used clothes are reused or recycled, with companies either organising their own programmes or contributing financially to an accredited collectively responsible organisation. Like H&amp;amp;M runs a voluntary collection scheme to accept used clothes of any brand, regardless of whether they are still usable or not, in their shops in return for a small reward.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulatory bodies or the government can step in and intervene to push companies to take that step. France is the only EU Member State to have an EPR law for clothes, in place since 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fashion as a service
Principles of the sharing economy can be used by new business models could increase the number of wears of particular item. Some brands already offer clothes as a service – leasing their clothes instead of selling them – taking their example from already well-established services of renting wedding and special occasion wear, protective clothes and newer services of renting maternity and baby clothes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other businesses operate clothing subscription services, which involves consumers paying a monthly fee to rent a fixed number of garments at a time, enabling them to change their wardrobe frequently without buying new clothes. Ex - Krate, Sugar Box etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sustainable clothing brands&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sustainable brands in a way, is a bit of an oxymoron. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To be sustainable in an actually meaningful way, the best thing to do is buying shop second hand/thrift, repair old clothes, to basically buy only what you need.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I don’t disappoint, brands who are ethically sourcing and producing clothes in a way that leads to a decrease in CO2 production, waste, water usage, is still better than most brands (not H&amp;amp;M’s Conscious line, it’s widely accused of greenwashing).  How to make sustainable fashion affordable? Well, you can’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So why is sustainable clothing expensive?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/a16158a67f8ae7eff551ce87baa4ff02/5.gif&quot; alt=&quot;It&amp;#x27;s so expensive GIF&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a variety of reasons, but I’ll try to explain this briefly. Two major cost buckets include - cost of fabric and cost of labour. As we have discussed above, if companies want to produce fibres, they have to invest heavily to ensure minimal wastage and reduce pollution, while also ensuring fair wage to their farmers and weavers. (You may have heard about the infamous &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Dhaka_garment_factory_collapse&quot;&gt;Rana Plaza factory collapse&lt;/a&gt; or about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/zara-inditex-workers-still-unpaid-1.4414831&quot;&gt;Zara’s factory working conditions and how it’s workers are under-paid&lt;/a&gt;.

So bigger companies like Zara can pay less for materials - even sustainable ones - because they’re buying in bulk. But ethical brands are usually smaller, and can’t take advantage of this concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affordability is a massive block for accessible sustainable clothing, and if you want lower prices you’re going to need to lower production costs which is what makes fashion so unethical and exploitative in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fun fact: Expensive clothing is not always sustainable, but sustainable clothing is always expensive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following is a list of sustianable fashion brands in India -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doodlage.in/&quot;&gt;Doodlage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thesummerhouse.in/&quot;&gt;The Summer House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wearvenn.com/#&quot;&gt;Venn&lt;/a&gt; (Hella expensive, but they have a thrift store, worth checking out)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ninetypercent.com/&quot;&gt;Ninety Percent&lt;/a&gt; (UK brand, but ships to India)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://noolbyhand.com/&quot;&gt;Nool By Hand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ka-shaindia.com/&quot;&gt;KaSha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nonasties.in/&quot;&gt;No nasties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anokhi.com/&quot;&gt;Anokhi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.upasana.in/&quot;&gt;Upasana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pomogrenade.com/&quot;&gt;Pomogrenade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all of the brands I have mentioned here, religiously engage in recycling and downcycling extensively and/or engage in fair trade practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, find a curated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ethicalfashion/comments/aqvexd/2019_master_list_for_ethical_fashion_brands/&quot;&gt;list of brands&lt;/a&gt; created by people around the globe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Compiling this list took a long time, and if I was a consumer looking to buy a product, I think having a specialized, easy-to-use platform will really help me to find and compare ethical fashion brands on the internet -  &lt;/em&gt;Notes down business idea* *)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making a personal commitment to only shop for sustainable clothes is not a concession, but rather a way of living your values, creating more individuality and uniqueness in your wardrobe. As more people make the choice to put their money into independent, sustainable, ethical, or secondhand fashion brands rather than fast fashion, the fashion industry’s major players will eventually realize they need to change.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pharma Industry - How technology can help in beating the COVID-19 crisis?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Since some time, the pharmaceutical supply chain has been struggling to cope.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since some time, the pharmaceutical supply chain has been struggling to cope. Companies rely on China heavily for manufacturing or for sourcing raw materials, and since global trade is suffering with stagnation, so has the pharmaceutical industry, which is also why countries around the world are making this their number 1 priority to manufacture locally, as much as they possibly can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;API dependence on China&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In India particularly, where the pharma industry is responsible for supplying over 50% of the global demand for various vaccines. According to a report about the Indian pharma industry, sourcing and procurement of &lt;strong&gt;APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and key starting materials (KSMs)&lt;/strong&gt; is a crucial part of the strategic plan to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major portion of the APIs for generic drug manufacturing across the globe are sourced from countries like India and China. To give some context, these 2 nations account for about 80% of the chemicals used to make drugs sold in Europe. And the glaring problem that arose was the fact that, Indian manufacturers rely heavily on APIs from China for the production of their medicine formulations, procuring around 70 percent from China, who is the top global producer and exporter of APIs, by volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak, exposed the dependency of the pharma sector on China for its API procurement. The disrupted supply chain along with the increased restrictions on exports due to manpower shortages in China’s manufacturing plants, had a devastating effect. Supplies were impacted by the disruption of logistic and transportation systems, restricting access and movement of products to and from ports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to 1991, the Indian pharmaceutical industry only imported 0.3% of its API requirements from China; then globalisation came into picture which led to a rise in large-scale formulation manufacturing prompted the increase in API procurement from China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary driver towards this choice was the &lt;strong&gt;low cost of production.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the Indian pharma and medical manufacturing firms have taken a hit and have fallen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/pharma-companies-capacity-utilisation-stood-at-50-60-till-may-17-report-5281371.html&quot;&gt;50-60% of their capacity&lt;/a&gt;, transport and shipping, and a labour shortage as migrant workers returned to their villages for lockdown, shipment costs increased two folds for cargo containers and around 4 times more for air freights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many experts from the pharmaceutical industry and NITI Aayog suggested that &lt;strong&gt;fostering the approvals of pharmaceutical infrastructure development, obtaining clearance from the environment department to convert brownfield units, alongwith a separate financial scheme and providing tax exemptions and subsidies&lt;/strong&gt; for the development and promotion of the pharmaceutical industry hubs could all be beneficial in tackling this crisis. The govt. announced production linked incentive (PLI) schemes to incentivise the production of APIs, but it is just not possible for every company to get benefited as there are various provisions which will be taken into consideration on priority, like, companies involved in backward integration, new age technology adoption etc. The government wants companies to innovate and adopt new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Technologies that will help companies fight the pandemic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using digital technologies for quality control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementing advanced analytics and automation for quality control, can reduce manual errors and improve quality, thus increasing productivity by 30-40%, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/pharmaceuticals-and-medical-products/our-insights/digitization-automation-and-online-testing-the-future-of-pharma-quality-control&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharma companies sit on a wealth of data, usually locked away in different technical and organizational silos. Some are already linking and mining their data sets to improve their pipelines, products, and strategies, but there still remains a huge opportunity to create further value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A great example of this digital transformation is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.expresscomputer.in/industries/pharma/how-cipla-is-embedding-digital-into-its-business-planning-and-execution/35007/&quot;&gt;Cipla’s API manufacturing plant&lt;/a&gt; in Kurukambh, India, which has fully embraced the power of digital technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes using real time data and tools like advanced analytics to identify KPIs, which then provides insights, for making strategic decisions. Use of digital information management systems, is helping in automating material flow and accurately capture cost-information with a paperless workflow. Moreover, they are also embracing the use of augmented reality and virtual reality technologies for employee training and plant maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embracing IT services to boost manufacturing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pharmaceutical industry has the reputation of being cautious about implementing new technology and slow to make changes. This conservatism is more or less due to regulatory requirements, to prove that any process modifications will not have a detrimental effect on product quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Information-Technology-Investments-and-Export-of-A-Bhat/b51a4d25798001368685103f5a0d19e20a8c2e2b&quot;&gt;investing in IT&lt;/a&gt; can, for example, boost the export performance of pharma firms. For Indian pharma firms that invest in building digital capabilities, exports make up 45% of sales, on average. For those that are digital followers rather than digital leaders, and invest less in new technology, exports make up only 28% of sales, on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digitalisation in manufacturing can help raise productivity and output, which will positively help in boosting exports. Digital platforms can provide better access to new markets through online sales channels and digital marketing. Plus, digital inventory management can further use valuable customer data in business models and can strengthen customer relationships through direct and quick communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investing in Research &amp;amp; Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;While observing the patenting activity in the pharma sector, it’s clear that India accounts for less than 2% of global pharmaceutical patents, significantly lower than China (at 8.75%), the U.S. (at 40% ) and the EU (at 22%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth in this area could be driven by a renewed appetite for business-risks, and a better approach to the research and development environment. Seeking uniformity between products produced in different states will be a helpful step, plus a step taken in  reskilling the India pharma workforce through new work incentives, training and resources will be fruitful. Being able to intelligently search vast data sets of patents, scientific publications, and clinical trials data should, in theory, help accelerate the discovery of new drugs by enabling researchers to examine previous results of tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A noteworthy example to look into is -  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qlik.com/us/company/press-room/press-releases/1206-lupin-pharmaceuticals-prescribes-qlik-for-healthier-decision-making&quot;&gt;Lupin&lt;/a&gt;, which is now using data science and analytics almost everywhere, including research and development, sales, finance, IT, manufacturing, quality and human resources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus pandemic has &lt;a href=&quot;https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/strategy-and-management/covid-19-will-increase-digitisation-in-pharma-firms-lupin-cio/76417037&quot;&gt;accelerated its adoption of digitalization&lt;/a&gt;, with the firm now digitizing access control systems through facial recognition and temperature measurements, while also using an online medium for training its employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firms need to invest in digital innovation to make services more personalized, physicians and patients more engaged, decisions more data driven and business practices more immediate. The industry and government leaders have to work hand-in-hand actively to maximize productivity gains and create employment opportunities to overcome the economic and social impacts of COVID-19 crisis. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Telehealth services are on the rise]]></title><description><![CDATA[The demand for triaging technologies, like conversational bots, has risen substantially as the coronavirus pandemic rages on, which isn’t…]]></description><link>https://catwomaniya.io/blog/healthcare-transformation/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://catwomaniya.io/blog/healthcare-transformation/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demand for triaging technologies, like conversational bots, has risen substantially as the coronavirus pandemic rages on, which isn’t surprising. Tech giants like IBM, Facebook, and Microsoft have engaged in  partnerships with governments and private industry to roll out chatbot-based solutions, as have a number of startups.  For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/news/gyant-raises-13-6m-series-a-from-wing-venture-capital/&quot;&gt;Gyant&lt;/a&gt;, whose AI-enabled health platform is designed to drive patient-doctor engagement, closed a $13.6 million round recently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In India, startups such as Practo, DocPrime and Lybrate were operating under a regulatory grey area. Unlike US, doctors in India are allowed to practice in any state. So it was always legal to practice telemedicine, but the regulations were never formalised. &lt;strong&gt;The Govt. Of India introduced a new comprehensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/Telemedicine.pdf&quot;&gt;framework&lt;/a&gt; on how to practice telehealth&lt;/strong&gt; in March, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just imagine - a service that is as old as the telephone, is making a comeback - &lt;strong&gt;Telehealth&lt;/strong&gt;. What cannot be ignored is, we may also look back on this challenging time as the moment when healthcare transformed to become more preventive, with a focus on health and care, keeping everyone in the community healthy and doing so more efficiently and cost-effectively.  Paperwork, payment, and other administrative burdens can be remotely automated by digital health services platforms, which will also, in turn help in lowering costs. Although this accelerated adoption, largely driven by the pandemic, is far from perfect, we’ve learned that much of our care can be delivered virtually. &lt;strong&gt;Healthcare is the most information intensive industry, yet it uses very less amount if IT or new technologies&lt;/strong&gt;, for some weird reason. Many ailments can be treated without physically going into a doctor’s office like back pain, headache, psychiatry, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know, other diseases haven taken a backseat as majorly all resources are going into treating Covid-19 patients. It’s troubling to even imagine how many childhood vaccinations that didn’t happen, screenings for cancer and other illnesses that didn’t happen. These services require movement to happen and only pre-planning and innovation can help when the need arises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, we also learned that it’s often healthier, both for the patient and the physician, to keep those who are sick and those who are vulnerable to health complications, at home, rather than coming to the doctor’s office, the ER, or the hospital. Paired with the fact that the single largest reason people do not access have to adequate healthcare, whether in urban settings or in rural ones, is transportation, virtual care is ideal. It’s still unsure how these consultations will be charged, because as per the guidelines, they should be charged just as a normal consultation is, but as per my discussion with certain healthcare providers during last week, they simply don’t have any idea about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventive care is not incentivised so no one cares about it, it’s only when procedures are being done, that can help you earn money. Length of stay in a hospital is the first metric to look for if you’re judging a hospital’s efficiency; it costs more for the hospital to take care of a person, so they would want it to be as low as possible. So to reduce spending in medical care, it’s important to get people out of institutions. &lt;strong&gt;More preventive care with cheap and innovative inventions will help keep people out of institutions.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pairing virtual solutions with more comprehensive at-home diagnostics and lab testing will free up our health and care system to focus more intently on what is most critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Orthopaedic surgery in severe bleeding disorders: A low-volume, high-cost procedure - Scientific Figure on ResearchGate.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This last week, I found myself buying health insurance for myself. My new job would have covered me, but that is out the window, and so is the possibility to get covered under company insurance(Thanks to the pandemic). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, I will explain my process I used to come to my choice. You can find plenty of websites explaining how to choose a health insurance, and some of the pointers I mention below may be repeated, but bear with me in the interest of making this comprehensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all answer this question - &lt;strong&gt;Who are you getting a health insurance for?&lt;/strong&gt;
People around me told me that the general thumb rule is - Insurance premium should be 6 times your salary. (You should also consider other factors like your age, dependents, current illnesses etc.). I was only looking for insurance for myself, if more members in my family weren’t covered, then there would be another decision making step here - whether to choose a family floater plan (calculated by using the age of the eldest member in the plan, to calculate premium) or individual plans for each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary factors to consider include the following, if you just want to get a basic idea about the insurance you’re choosing-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cashless hospitalisation&lt;/strong&gt; (Medical treatment done without paying the bills yourself)
Normally, if you get a treatment done the amount will be paid out of your pocket and will be reimbursed later on by the insurance company. Not everyone has that much liquid cash lying around, so now more and more people are actively looking for hospitals which their insurance company can directly cover. See if the best hospitals in your area, are in the list.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In-patient hospitalisation coverage&lt;/strong&gt; (When you stay at the hospital for medication/treatment for more than 24 hours)
Most insurance companies provide a 100% coverage, but there are exceptions. Always choose one which has maximum coverage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coverage for day-care treatment&lt;/strong&gt; (Procedures that are completed in 24 hours)
It’s self-explanatory, the higher it is the better. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Room rent allowance&lt;/strong&gt;
Some plans have no capping on room rent, some allow a certain percentage. Try to find what is the maximum allowance is for a hospital room nearby.
It’s really peculiar to me why almost no one discloses this information beforehand, because it can vary a lot. I went through old hospital bills of times when my parents were admitted to a hospital, in my city, and I couldn’t get a quote for government hospitals, but in the private hospitals, the charge averaged around INR 2000, and that also involved around a multitde of factors, including food, cleaning charges, television, medications etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre and post hospitalisation expenses&lt;/strong&gt; (Reimbursement of expenses prior to hospitalisation &amp;amp; post discharge costs)
It is typically 30 days before hospitalisation and 60 days after hospitalisation. Though some plans put limitations on coverage amount, so it’s better talk to the customer service to get clarification.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sub limits for certain expenses/treatment&lt;/strong&gt; (cap of how much a policyholder can claim for a particular expense)
Particularly - Cataract surgery may have sub limit per eye, maternity (Normal delivery and Casearean delivery costs differ)
Whatever I found, it’s mostly ailments that effects the elderly, something that doesn’t concern me. I skimmed through the document but I will advice reading the fine print in the policy document.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other factors to consider -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waiting period&lt;/strong&gt; - Only if you have pre-existing illness. The lower it is the better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Co-payment&lt;/strong&gt; - Share of claim you need to pay from your own pocket. Mostly seen in senior citizens or specific need plans. No co-pay means that, in theory, you pay nothing and the insurance covers all costs. I say ‘in theory’ because some costs might not be covered by your plan and you might have to pay.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exclusions&lt;/strong&gt; - These treatments are not covered by health plan. Typically, include Dental, Eye care (unless you were hospitalised) etc. You should be aware of this, so I’m restating this, DO READ THE POLICY DOCUMENT or get clarification from the company. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eecdb0568aa1ae072db2d42ac0fecf5d/tenor.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Homer Simpson struggling to read a long book&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benefits to enhance Sum assured -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No claim bonus&lt;/strong&gt; - Insurance companies increase amount of sum assured by some percentage for the next year, if the insurance amount is not claimed for 1 year, 2 years, etc. This is not a must-have but a nice-to-have feature given high medical inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restoration for additional coverage&lt;/strong&gt; - In case you spend the entire sum assured, the insurer would add more coverage without taking additional premium.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this criteria, I went on to check plans on policybazaar.com and started screening them. And from the list of options, I also checked the LiveMint Mediclaim Ratings for the past few years, just to see how my choices were performing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livemint.com/static/mediclaim-rating-2019&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livemint.com/mintmediratings2018&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livemint.com/Object/1XhvIv1t7ce1r1WiQ4BoyJ/mediclaimrating-2017.html&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally decided with HDFC Ergo (formerly known as Apollo Munich). They were consistently in the top ranks, and were more suitable to my needs, with more number of cashless hospitals in my areas than any other company. The only con here is maybe they charge a lot more than most insurers, however I have some reviews that tell me the reimbursement procedure is hassle-free and comparatively faster, and that is worth the extra amount.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Advertisers Vs Facebook]]></title><description><![CDATA[In the past few days, there has been a rise in the number of companies boycotting Facebook as a platform for advertising.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past few days, there has been a rise in the number of companies boycotting Facebook as a platform for advertising. Last I checked, more than 800 companies have pulled out their money from Facebook. It started out initially as a #StopHateForProfit campaign, to call out Facebook to up its game on content moderation, after Facebook didn’t take any action on the post by President Trump stating “… When the looting starts, the shooting starts”, which many people thought provoked violence. (It does, it felt like a dog whistle). And then many small companies, who are relatively active in social issues, jumped in on the #BoycottFacebook movement.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the boycott came quickly, the relationship between advertisers and Facebook has been stressful since a couple of years, and it was just a matter of opportunistic time for advertisers to take a strong stand on the matter, because most of all, every company wants to keep its brand safe and away from hate speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the advent of new technologies and digital platforms, the world of advertising has changed. Platforms like Facebook, have given advertisers the opportunity to connect with the right audience and not go by the old let’s-see-what-sticks method, and spend millions for a widescale advertising campaign. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it also brought along a number of problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a challenge for advertisers to actually know how many people were even seeing their ads or to know what their ads were appearing next to. Facebook disclosed in 2016 that they had &lt;a href=&quot;https://money.cnn.com/2016/11/16/technology/facebook-ad-metrics/index.html&quot;&gt;overestimated how long people actually spent watching ads on their platform&lt;/a&gt;. The number was &lt;strong&gt;off by around 80%&lt;/strong&gt;, which was a real blow to all the advertisers, because from the outside it looked like a really powerful platform with plenty of data to work with, but after this disclosure, it became difficult to trust it, and FB was pushed to start auditing their media metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, YouTube faced a similar issue, when brands realised that their ads were being played before objectionable videos, and many complained like P&amp;amp;G, AT&amp;amp;T etc. and started a boycott and stopped spending money on the platform immediately. And it pushed Google to hire more people to moderate content, spend more on AI to weed out “bad videos” and gave brands more power to decide where their ads would appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fundamental issue here is - AI is still developing, and will need time to perfect itself. And even if companies try and hire a bunch load of people to moderate content, it would take an enormous amount of investment of time, labor and money to actually do it. So this is a real headscratcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether Facebook will really be dented, either financially or as a brand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional links: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-networks/complete-list-facebooks-misreported-metrics-and-what-they-mean&quot;&gt;https://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-networks/complete-list-facebooks-misreported-metrics-and-what-they-mean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[le idiot box, le idiot me]]></title><description><![CDATA[It's been 9 years and I just realized this recently, that throughout this period I have always been hooked onto some Tv show; I felt a void…]]></description><link>https://catwomaniya.io/blog/tv-and-me/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://catwomaniya.io/blog/tv-and-me/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:400px&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been 9 years and I just realized this recently, that throughout this period I have always been hooked onto some Tv show; I felt a void in my life when I wasn’t watching a show. It becomes absolutely necessary for me to start a new series as soon as I’m done with one. I need something to watch when I am having my meals and it just feels strange to eat my food in complete silence, without any distractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know how Tv isn’t good for you right? Right. But we’re humans and we all share one distinct mental flaw (actually many but let’s focus on one for now). It’s in our habit to utilize our money’s worth on objects/services that we pay for. And that’s why when I am paying ₹200/month for a Netflix subscription I want to consume as much content as I can. I’m completely genre-agnostic and I have watched shows ranging from &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Futurama&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Bleach&lt;/em&gt; and even filth like &lt;em&gt;Desperate Housewives&lt;/em&gt;. I started watching Tv shows actively in 2011 after I was introduced to a funny show called F.R.I.E.N.D.S. And because they had a duration of 20-minutes, I slowly increased the frequency of episodes I could watch at a go. There was a time when I would just play an episode on my laptop and do my work because I liked the background noise. In the time it’s taken me to write this blog, I’ve already dived into several episodes of The IT crowd. (Brilliant show, btw. British humor at its best)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have tried replacing these series with podcasts but haven’t been successful (yet). The worst thing is, I was an avid reader before all of this, now I can only read short stories because my attention span has decreased and of course there are certain other factors that caused this change, I’m sure the availability of a plethora of creative content just a button away, plays an important role here. With the advent of Amazon Prime, Hotstar and the Holy Grail of instant TV, Netflix, television has never been more accessible, which is wonderful for our instant-gratification-generation minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/a0f46e5965b5d45ab49daed26a33cd67/IG.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Cat pressing button animation&amp;quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online TV not only changes the way we consume TV, but also influences the television-viewing experience. In the good old days, if you watch one episode of your favorite show on a Friday, you would have to wait until the next Friday to resume the series, giving you ample amount of time to come act and act as a productive member of society. But if you log on to Netflix and hit play on that first pilot episode of any show, there is nothing stopping you from passively allowing the next episode to automatically play until you’re unsure what day it is. Now I can pick what I want to watch and become absorbed in it, with no commercials to jolt me back to reality or obligations. It is both convenient to know that I can watch TV when it suits me and tempting to waste inordinate amounts of time that should be rather spent of reading papers or learning new skills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how many people follow the same routine. A routine that has led me to watch some 70 odd Tv series till date. And it’s not like I do it casually, I remember every one of those episodes, for some, I even remember the dialogues by heart (Its nerve wrecking).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no silver lining here, except for the fact that I mostly learnt English by watching these shows.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Vaccine development for COVID-19]]></title><description><![CDATA[I will go out on a limb and state here that the Covid-19 pandemic is the most defining aeon of our lifetime.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will go out on a limb and state here that the Covid-19 pandemic is the most defining aeon of our lifetime. Every other concern has become secondary, the primary focus right now is to find a cure for the Covid-19 virus. Research for treating the coronavirus, is being done in record time. New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) reported in February, that it was getting upto 20 submissions each day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did my bachelors in the field of Biotechnology, and in my first class on genetic engineering, we learnt about vaccine development and how it takes years to develop a vaccine (on an average, 10 years). But we don’t have that kind of time now, and companies have been working on overdrive to generate a vaccine for the coronavirus.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To give you some context, the following is the time involved in clinical trials -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before all of this, months are spent on lab and animal testing. And, some companies are already in Phase 2, which speaks about the fast progress in vaccine development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;How do vaccines work?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two basic types of vaccines - Live attenuated and inactivated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live attenuated vaccines&lt;/strong&gt; are produced by modifying the virus in the laboratory, such that it can replicate itself but won’t cause any illness.(Ex- Measles, Yellow fever etc.). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inactivate vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;, as the name suggests, are produced by creating the virus I culture media, then inactivating it with heat and/or chemicals, so that it wouldn’t replicate. In contrast with live vaccines, that almost resemble a natural infection, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;antibody titers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (a measure of amount of antibodies, specifically neutralizing antibodies; used to check if a vaccine is working) against inactivated antigens diminish with time, so multiple doses or ”&lt;em&gt;boosts&lt;/em&gt;” may be required. (Ex- Polio, Rabies, Hep A etc).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratories around the world are now working to create these different kinds of vaccines, but all of them have one goal, to train the immune system to recognize and combat the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An essential entity that is going to help develop the vaccine is - &lt;em&gt;the spikes&lt;/em&gt;; these spikes are the genetic material that will be identified by our immune system so that it can fight it. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moderna&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, for example, is developing it’s mRNA Covid-19 vaccine, where  the goal is to, inject the ”&lt;em&gt;spike&lt;/em&gt;“(mRNA) into our body which will translate it into a protein, which our immune system will identify and then exterminate (which is pretty cool, tbh). &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;GSK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; just started its clinical trials, last Friday, with its booster shots. Some companies are even trying to inject the mRNA inside our body by using a totally different, harmless virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a vaccine for the coronavirus ?
Not yet. (So the best chances for your survival is wearing &lt;strong&gt;the god damn mask&lt;/strong&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good thing is, people around the world are working to make it a reality soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;When will the vaccine be ready?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Fauci, gave us all hope that the vaccine may be ready by early 2021. According to the latest update, WHO stated recently that &lt;strong&gt;10 out of the 120 vaccines&lt;/strong&gt; being developed globally are already in human trials. Looking at how fast China is working on a promising development and the fact that it has already published an article in the peer-reviewed medical journal, The Lancelet, about the first in-human clinical trials, we may even have it sooner, but there are some serious concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who had contracted the coronavirus and then recovered, had a antibody titer count of at least a 100, so it’s safe to say that &lt;strong&gt;100&lt;/strong&gt; should ideally be a antibody titer target for any vaccine. In the case of the Chinese vaccine study mentioned earlier, out of the three doses administered to the odd 100 volunteers, the highest dose averaged around a count of 34, which is way less. Moreover, 81% of the participants developed at least one adverse reaction within the first seven days of vaccination, so there’s still a big question mark on the safety of these vaccines. Similarly, Moderna reported 3 out of its 45 participants, experiencing severe but non-threatening symptoms, all of these 3 participants were given the high dose. During these kind of experimental vaccines, side-effects are pretty common, and with further trials, the dosage is decreased gradually until they find the ideal amount, that has less or negligible reactions and is also able to do its job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Is it possible to make enough of this vaccine for everyone?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To actually create a traditional vaccine, it’s essential that you have cells where you can grow them. You put the weakened virus into the cells, create a good environment for them in a bio-reactor and feed it with nutrients, so that it grows well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE CELLS = MORE VACCINES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But all of this takes months to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To counter this, the mRNA vaccines can be a game-changer, because you won’t be spending time growing the cells, essentially creating multiple doses. The slight issue here being, this has never been done before, so some problems may pop up, but experts agree that producing mRNA in mass quantities is a likely possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although, even if we actually get a promising vaccine, there’s still something companies are really worried about, that may sound trivial - &lt;em&gt;where to put the vaccines?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are stored in &lt;strong&gt;small vials with stoppers&lt;/strong&gt;, that are extremely sterile, and are produced in places that are 100 times cleaner than a hospital. And even though these guys have ramped up all the steps for vaccine production, the real constraint here is to ramp up the production of these tubes, in quality conditions, while also figuring out methods to minimize the delay causing factors, like packaging. Many public-health experts and pharmaceutical leaders have stated publicly that they are worried about a potential glass-vial supply squeeze, due to the pandemic. Of course, rolling out billions of vaccine at record speed is no easy task, and it’s necessary to think and plan of solutions for possible problems that may need to be sorted out. For which, it’s essential to look at the supply chain from the &lt;em&gt;start to the end&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with producing medical glass equipment is that it’s supply chain is traditionally fixed, and slow-growing, which means that it is also prone to shortages, such as this one. It only produces on a need-basis, so it doesn’t have surge capacity to cater to emergency situations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This glass market is inclined towards fragmentation. The surge in government initiatives and increasing demand for injectables and other medicines provide lucrative opportunities in the glass packaging solutions in the pharmaceutical industry. Competitive rivalry is high and the expansion and mergers of large companies in different pharmaceutical industries are expected to increase the demand in the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But a medical glass shortage was already setting in before the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/strong&gt;  Procuring raw material is an issue, since sand found alongside riversides is needed, which is different and coarse than the fine, desert sand, which has suffered a setback due to increase in environmental regulations. And even after obtaining these materials, normal glass factories have to undergo significant changes to ramp up vial production. A beverage glass maker cannot simply start producing medical glass equipment. In India itself, it has been difficult, logistically, for bottles and vials makers to provide to pharma companies. For instance, AGI glaspac’s pharma segment, which currently contributes 30-32 % of glass packaging in the Indian pharma packaging industry, is facing hampered production, affected supplies, and increased stock. So far, the company is working partially with limited raw materials like sand and soda ash, the key input raw materials for glass packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rick Bright, formerly the head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), alleges he warned of a looming global shortage of glass vials but administration officials did not heed his advice. He wrote that major glass producers have warned that a particular material, borosilicate tubing, is sold out and it could take up to two years to meet the U.S. vaccine need alone .Even after the first batch of vaccines have been sourced and the shortages managed, coronavirus vaccines may have to be followed up every few years, meaning the strain on the supply chain could reappear in just a few years time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe for the first time in world history, companies like Pfizer and Moderna are planning to start manufacturing vaccines on a large scale, while still being in the trial phase, just so that they can cope with the demand when the vaccine is finally approved.
Some manufacturers are already preparing for this potential crunch: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.modernatx.com/modernas-work-potential-vaccine-against-covid-19&quot;&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt; is exploring both single-use vials and those that can hold multiple vaccine doses, according to its regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shortage of vials could interfere not just with the availability of a coronavirus vaccine but a range of other medicines, including sedatives and other drugs administered in hospitals. It’s strange, in the end, everything boils down to &lt;strong&gt;LOGISTICS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;All of these research and scientific articles is freely available, after 94 academic journals, societies, institutes and companies signed a commitment to do so. It’s open to the public, if anyone’s interested.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sustainable sex - Environmental impact of used condoms]]></title><description><![CDATA[It was a regular Sunday for me.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a regular Sunday for me. I was having breakfast and watching a documentary on Sony BBC called “Extreme Engineering”, when suddenly a question popped in my head “What happens to used condoms after they are thrown in trash?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little context, I gave myself only one goal for 2020, to practice sustainable living by investigating and implementing low-waste alternatives into my lifestyle. Now we know plastic is bad, god knows how many times I have found cows on the street, all bloated and dead, after eating plastic. It’s toxic and it’s killing us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cannot stress enough about how important condoms are for some people, it’s the most cost-effective, easily available birth control method on the market, and the only way to prevent STIs/STDs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should definitely be using a condom.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the only question remains, what happens to it afterwards? After it’s thrown in the garbage and collected by the garbage truck?z&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After some extensive research, I tried to calculate a number to estimate the number of condoms that are being used in a day. It’s about - &lt;strong&gt;19.8 million&lt;/strong&gt;. And that’s a pretty huge number, when you take into account that 39600kgs of waste generated every day will last in the world for some hundreds of years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;WHAT ARE CONDOMS MADE OF?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Condom companies are rarely transparent about their ingredients. They use non-visible additives and chemicals, even in ‘natural latex’ condoms’, which are rarely 100% natural and thus will not decompose for a long time. But for the sake of being optimistic, latex condoms can be broken down for the most part, polyurethane condoms just can’t. And definitely not if it’s coated with lubricant or spermicide or if it hits the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There just isn’t any study to tell us exactly how much time it takes for a condom- lubricated or not- to break down, plus there aren’t enough experimental studies done with condoms for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;CURRENT SCENARIO&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report by the UN, tells me there are 3 primary ways how condoms are disposed off - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;General landfill &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Specific burial&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incineration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with disposing waste in the ground, other than the risk of scavenging, is that the plastics enter the water cycle and we end up with microplastics inside us. And I am no genius, but that cannot possibly be good for our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leaves us with the option of burning. The major materials (Rubber, Polyethylene, Hydrocarbons, Silicone) in condoms and their packs are combustible and have a high fuel value. So it is actually an energy-efficient means of disposal if the energy of combustion can be recovered (like using it for electricity production). High temperature incinerators are also used for destroying hazardous medical waste, and may be available for condom destruction. However, it is likely that such incinerators would have a relatively low capacity. (Some good news, finally. But have to check the feasibility for doing so.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;SO WHAT CAN I DO AS AN INDIVIDUAL?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well,  a quick search on Google will tell you how to dispose off condoms in the trash and NOT throw it in the recycling bin or flush it down the toilet, or worse, reuse it. UGH. Governments, NGOs, corporations, social marketing organizations have told people to use condoms, but no one ever tells on how to properly dispose them, even though they have the potential to do so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fret not, fellow nature lover, being sexually active and sustainable is an option now. There are people who are working everyday to find an eco-friendly way to degrade condoms, in a controlled environment, without affecting the environment. New companies have come up that are now manufacturing eco-friendly condoms -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greencondom.club/green-condoms&quot;&gt;Green Condom Club&lt;/a&gt;
They do not contain any toxic chemicals and clearly list the ingredients used for manufacturing, as well as being produced and tested according to the strictest CE and ISO norms to be safe and reliable!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fairsquared.info/fairtrade-products-en/condoms-en/&quot;&gt;Fair Squared&lt;/a&gt;
The condoms are made from natural latex and fairtrade rubber, ethically farmed in South India, where the company aim to improve the working and living conditions of the primary producers in Kerala. They are certified with a CE mark and tested to the highest possible International standard ISO 4074&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sustainnatural.com/products/condoms&quot;&gt;Sustain Natural&lt;/a&gt;
The Fair Trade rubber is made in a solar-powered factory in a plantation in India, where they pay their workers fair wages and treat them with respect. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUN FACT&lt;/strong&gt; : A study shows that going childless is a better way help the environment than recycling or driving an energy-efficient car, it’s 20 times more effective, to be exact. So in some ways, condoms are actually good for the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you know of some sources that I should read, please do reach out to me on Twitter or email.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for indulging me in my exploration of whether condoms can be recycled!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to get customer insight without doing surveys]]></title><description><![CDATA[In the first class of Marketing 101, I learnt that customer insight is the core of any product/service you wish to sell.

As a marketing student, my projects mostly involved doing surveys and focus group discussions and although not being a master at market research I did learn the basics of it. Although, there were many times I just couldn’t find that niche group of people who I wanted to study nor did I have money lying around to pay someone to do it for me, I had to rely on other publicly available resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three things really helped me to get some external input - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Social media &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research reports&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Web Tools&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h4&gt;SOCIAL MEDIA&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a ton of websites where people go to share their feedbacks or raise complaints about products. Social media has given people a chance to express themselves, build communities, interact and involve with the communications giving scope to more engagement between people. This is a gold mine of information, that’s waiting to be harnessed. This can be done in two steps - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 1. Text scraping &lt;/strong&gt; - Can be done using a tool webscraper.io, which has a chrome/firefox extension to extract specific data from websites. The tool allows the user to build Site Maps from different types of selectors. Creating a sitemap and selectors tells the system what to do during the scraping process so that data can be extracted.&lt;strong&gt; 2. Text mining and visualization &lt;/strong&gt; - The data can be cleaned later on in Excel by removing irrelevant data and segregating it. This data can be further visualized using a tool called VOSviewer to find the most occuring words and identify the broad theme of words/relation between them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Popular sites where people provide feedback - Yelp, TripAdvisor, Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;RESEARCH REPORTS&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone has access to industrial reports from Gartner etc. One can still find multitude of reports on the internet to understand customer behaviour, although it takes a considerable amount of time to research and find the relevant ones.
Some sites that I have found useful include - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 1. Think with Google &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 2. Nielsen Reports &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 3. Revuze blog &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 4. Research papers of educuational institutes &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;h4&gt;WEB TOOLS&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a huge chunk of your customer base has access to internet, it’s imperative to look into their search history. There are sites like AnswerThePublic (my personal favorite, see image below), which can tell you what people are searching for on the internet, by using search data from sites like Google and Bing. What stands out is the interface and the fact that it can shed out some cool infographics for easy visualization. It seriously is an underrated website, and can be useful for many, like if you want ideas for creating content for your Instagram handle or if you want to target the best SEO keywords.

This is Parichay and I am making this short post on behalf of Shweta. Today’s her birthday. Had the world been functioning normal, I would have perhaps been in Mumbai to celebrate this day.
But the uncertain planet had different plans. Today is the 53rd day of lockdown in India while the entire world seems to have fallen head over heels. This is perhaps the most uncanny time to
be celebrating a birthday. She graduated from her college 2 months back without a convocation, quarantined herself for 21 days at home, her luggage from hostel arrived only today after
2 months, she is unable start her new job and stuck away from her dream post-college life. Despite all her ordeals she has been constantly trying to find her motivation and discipline.
She occassionally cooks food, feeds the cats, washes the cats, saves the cats from dogs and trains herself. After all she is a self-proclaimed Catwoman. 😎&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/62b2d67d43a76caacc3e7a1af1b56a81/bday-poster.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Birthday Poster&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no way possible to do a normal birthday celebration this time. So I decided to build and gift her this blog. It had been a long time pending request with me. She had been wanting a
beautiful blog but me being lazy never picking up this project. Well this blog at the current state is not beautiful to say the least but the project has finally begun! Thanks to her birthday. I have
put some efforts during the weekend to build this blog. I hope she will write more often now that she doesn’t have an excuse of “nowhere to post”. I am not buying her any gifts and donating to
WHO Solidarity Response Fund in her honor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I just donated to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19Fund?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#COVID19Fund&lt;/a&gt; to support &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WHO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@WHO&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#x27;s response efforts to the global &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#COVID19&lt;/a&gt; pandemic.

A frail roadmap is planned with more features like newsletter subscription, comments (so that people can wish here), dark mode, tags, about section, better font perhaps and better layout definitely.
