Experts beleive a significant perecentage of these jobs will not be recovered.</em></strong></p>\n<p>It’s kind of hard to imagine the social and economic effect that is coming our way, it doesn’t look good at all.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_COVID_19_Risks_Outlook_Special_Edition_Pages.pdf\">COVID-19 Risks Outlook - A Preliminary Mapping and its Implications</a> raises the alarm bell on a potential vicious future cycle of “continued environmental degradation, biodiversity loss and further zoonotic infectious disease outbreaks”</p>\n<p>While it’s definitely tempting to compare current economic projections with the 2008 financial crisis, it’s not going to be the same. The aftermath is going to be more problematic.</p>\n<p>To quote Nobel laureate economist, Joseph E. Stiglitz, <strong><em>“In many ways, it’s far worse than 2008.”</em></strong></p>\n<p>While it’s tempting to fall back to old methods and rely on the economist’s traditional toolbox to fix these problems, this may be an opportunity for institutes and think tanks around the world, to make a case for a shift in economic thinking. In the wake of a dire socio-economic crisis, what seems impossible or what was deemed unnecessary a few months back, is now on the forefront.</p>\n<p>The answer is a <strong>doughnut</strong>. </p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"/ed683e65da28294e232890f1c687b670/doh.gif\" alt=\"Homer Simpson with donuts\">\n</p>\n \nThe brainchild of Kate Raworth, an English economist working for the University of Oxford, authored the book **&#x201C;Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist&#x201D;** which was a hit and is again gaining quite some eyeballs after the pandemic hit.\n<p>Raworth’s bestselling book (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.in/Doughnut-Economics-Kate-Raworth/dp/1847941389\">Amazon</a>) has graced the bedside tables of multiple economists and politicians. It is described as a “breakthrough alternative to growth economics”</p>\n<p>Drawn as two concentric circles (i.e., donut) explaining the flow between materials and energy, to remind us that we are more than just workers and cash generators/consumers. It’s a graphical representation of the world we should create. The inner ring of the doughnut is inspired by the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and represents the minimum things we need to lead a good life –clean water, shelter, gender equality. The outer ring of the doughnut is defined by the ecological limits one oughts to respect to avoid damaging the environment and disrupting the climate. The ‘dough’, therefore, represents the resources we can use.</p>\n<h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE BOOK</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Questions present images of the exclusive goal of economy as growth, of economy as a self-contained system and humans as rational, self-interested and dominant over nature.</li>\n<li>Talks about market organism, rather than market mechanisms. Wonders if economists would see themselves as gardeners who are stewards rather than believing that things will self-regulate.</li>\n<li>Explore the dynamics of a complex organic economic system, that is distributive and regenerative  by design. Regenerative by design gives a way for people to become full participants in regenerating Earth’s life giving cycles so that we thrive within planetary boundaries. </li>\n<li>Wonders about an economic design that promotes human prosperity whether GDP is going up, down, or holding steady.</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/7f026fb020151431439b1c163e22a619/33064/7.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 77.70270270270271%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Donut econmics model from her book\" title=\"Donut econmics model from her book\" src=\"/static/7f026fb020151431439b1c163e22a619/1c72d/7.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/7f026fb020151431439b1c163e22a619/a80bd/7.jpg 148w,\n/static/7f026fb020151431439b1c163e22a619/1c91a/7.jpg 295w,\n/static/7f026fb020151431439b1c163e22a619/1c72d/7.jpg 590w,\n/static/7f026fb020151431439b1c163e22a619/33064/7.jpg 837w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n</p>\n<h3>NO CRITICISM?</h3>\n<p>Well, of course, there is. </p>\n<p>Free-market economists have criticized Raworth’s theories, stating that her ambitious programs needed to meet social needs and protect the environment are impossible without massive economic growth.</p>\n<p>Also, it fails to give a clear explanantion about the socially-contructed desired minimum levels and the thresholds above which environmnetal problems are likely.

For instance, buildings will get a ‘materials passport’ so that demolition companies can determine whether materials are still valuable and/or where reusable materials can be found. </p>\n<p>The municipality also plans on reducing its own use of new raw materials by 20% and by 2030, only make circular purchases. (What the heck are <a href=\"http://circularpp.eu/\">circular purchases</a>?) This is not just applicable to the procurement of products such as office supplies, computer equipment but also to infrastructure projects such as road-building.</p>\n<p>Amsterdam has already started working with businesses and research organisations on over 200 circular economy projects</p>\n<p>Although, experts also suggest that this isn’t going to be easy.
