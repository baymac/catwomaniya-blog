This is Parichay and I am making this short post on behalf of Shweta. Today‚Äôs her birthday. Had the world been functioning normal, I would have perhaps been in Mumbai to celebrate this day.\nBut the uncertain planet had different plans. Today is the 53rd day of lockdown in India while the entire world seems to have fallen head over heels. This is perhaps the most uncanny time to\nbe celebrating a birthday. She graduated from her college 2 months back without a convocation, quarantined herself for 21 days at home, her luggage from hostel arrived only today after\n2 months, she is unable start her new job and stuck away from her dream post-college life. Despite all her ordeals she has been constantly trying to find her motivation and discipline.\nShe occassionally cooks food, feeds the cats, washes the cats, saves the cats from dogs and trains herself. After all she is a self-proclaimed Catwoman. üòé</p>\n<p><img src=\"/62b2d67d43a76caacc3e7a1af1b56a81/bday-poster.gif\" alt=\"Birthday Poster\"></p>\n<p>There was no way possible to do a normal birthday celebration this time. So I decided to build and gift her this blog. It had been a long time pending request with me. She had been wanting a\nbeautiful blog but me being lazy never picking up this project. Well this blog at the current state is not beautiful to say the least but the project has finally begun! Thanks to her birthday. I have\nput some efforts during the weekend to build this blog. I hope she will write more often now that she doesn‚Äôt have an excuse of ‚Äúnowhere to post‚Äù. I am not buying her any gifts and donating to\nWHO Solidarity Response Fund in her honor. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I just donated to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19Fund?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19Fund</a> to support <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WHO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@WHO</a>&#39;s response efforts to the global <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> pandemic.

A frail roadmap is planned with more features like newsletter subscription, comments (so that people can wish here), dark mode, tags, about section, better font perhaps and better layout definitely.\nThis blog is open source so welcoming your contributions/suggestions at <a href=\"https://github.com/baymac/catwomaniya-blog\">baymac/catwomaniya-blog</a>.
